My name is erika, but I go by 'E,' but whichever is OK! I am a student at Ohio State University. Management Information Systems, and I plan to enter software development in the business sector once I graduate. I am a Full-Stack Developer with Ohio State's Office of Technology and Innovation. Currently, we are working on preparing an application for multi-tenancy to conduct a planned full back-end swap to .Net and C#. I like bike riding, playing video games, watching Formula 1, and building Legos in my spare time!
